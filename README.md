# Park-It-Easy
It is a web based system implementing client-server model. It overcomes the problem of finding a parking space in parking areas that unnecessary consumes time. Hence, this project offers a web application based reservation system where persons can view various parking spaces and select nearby or specific area of their choice to view whether space is available or not. If the booking space is available, then they can book it for specific time slot. The booked space will be marked and will not be available for anyone else for the specified time. This system provides an additional feature of cancelling the bookings. They can cancel their reserved space anytime. They can also view previous parking booking details using the webportal.
